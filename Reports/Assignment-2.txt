Q1. Does your program output any garbage? If yes, why?
A. Yes. Our program does generate garbage values due to lack of synchromization between producer and consumer. This happens due to unscheduled preemption between producer and consumer. When a printf statement is executed in either a producer or a consumer program, the unscheduled preemption takes place and outputs garbage values.

Q2. Are all the produced values getting consumed? Check your program for small count like 20.
A. No. Since there is no synchromization between consumer and producer, not all the values produced by producer are consumed by consumer. After a producer produces many values, preemption takes place and the consumer only consumes the last value produced by producer.

Functions used:
void producer(int count)
void consumer(int count)
